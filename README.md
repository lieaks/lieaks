### Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

I was a Specialty Coffee professional and I retrained toward tech industry with the same passion for well crafted products and attention to detail, willing to integrate a tech team and bring my creativity and expertise in.  
I am now a Ã‰cole 42 Paris student willing to keep the never-ending learning process going to adapt to your projects and help bring them further.  
Reach me now to know how we can collaborate by email: david_ly@hotmail.fr.
Currently open to Paris based opportunities, remote or partial remote are welcome too.
